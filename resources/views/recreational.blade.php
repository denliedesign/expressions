                    <strong>What is AcroDance?</strong>
                    <br>AcroDance is the beautiful fusion of the artistic motion of dance and the athleticism of acrobatics.  AcroDance is not the same as gymnastics.  An AcroDancer must complete all of the skills on the hard stage without the advantage of a sprung floor, while seamlessly integrating musicality, emotional expressions, extension, control, and line.  The sprung floor allows the gymnast to complete much more difficult tumbling when compared to what is recommended in AcroDance.  Skills taught in AcroDance might look the same as gymnastics, but they are taught differently to compensate for the conditions.  Neither the “AcroDance” way nor the “Gymnastics” way are wrong, but they are different.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Why Acrobatic Arts?</strong>
                    <br>Acrobatic Arts is a progression-based syllabus program for teaching AcroDance.  Thoughtful progressions and structured levels assist teachers to properly train their dancers’ bodies to advance to the next level only when they are ready for it.  This greatly reduces the potential for injury, creates more technically correct work, and helps dancers to progress more quickly (in the long run).
