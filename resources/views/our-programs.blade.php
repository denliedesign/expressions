                <ul>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>First Steps and FUNdamentals</strong> - This introductory program is for our youngest students (ages 18 months to 7 years old) to encourage and foster a love of music and movement. The focus is on gross motor development, coordination, and listening skills through age-appropriate music and props.. We offer session classes with exciting themes as well as weekly classes like ballet, tap, acrobatics, and hip hop, with some classes participating in our recitals.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>Essentials</strong> - This program expands on our early childhood programs, continuing to develop gross motor skills, coordination, memorization, and musicality. We also introduce classes like jazz, lyrical, and heels along with foundational ballet, tap, and jazz classes. We do require that ballet be taken along with jazz and/or lyrical.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>Track</strong> - Dancers must demonstrate proficiency in our Essentials classes to move on to our fast-tracked dance program. Each level in our Track program increases in difficulty and teachers must recommend when students are ready to move on to the next level. Our Track program relies heavily on technique in the foundational ballet, jazz, and lyrical classes and a minimum is required for each dancer along with elective classes like acrobatics, hip hop, heels, musical theater, stretch and strength, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>Musical Theater</strong> - Our Expressions Children’s Theater program is for young kids and teens with an interest in musical theater and acting. Our Musical Theater KIDS class (typically offered in a 6-8 week session) introduces the world of theater focusing on fun, imagination, and structured learning with an emphasis on ensemble performing. Our Musical Theater JUNIOR class offers more intense work in audition preparation, staging, costuming, and makeup, while strengthening and enhancing each student’s skills in acting, vocals, and movement. Performance opportunities include stage performances, in-studio performances and season performances with our Expressions dancers.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>RemarkABLE Movement</strong> - We believe that music and rhythm is inside ALL of us, and no matter the limitation, everyone should be given the freedom to explore movement in their own way. Together with a caregiver, therapist, or dance "buddy", kids and teens with physical limitations and learning challenges will explore movement through exciting weekly dance classes through RemarkABLE Movement. Each class will be taught by our certified Rhythm Works Integrative Dance Instructor and dedicated adult and student assistants. There are several opportunities for our RemarkABLE dancers to perform for the community! Our dancers have participated in the Down Syndrome Association of Greater Cincinnati Buddy Walk, Northern Kentucky Capernaum events, The Point Ark of Northern Kentucky social dances, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital fundraising events for the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, area nursing homes, and Expressions Dance Theatre shows.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>Expressions Ballet Corps</strong> - This is an advanced-level ballet course that is designed for students preparing for professional careers in dance. Emphasizing classical technique, artistry, and performance readiness, the class includes technique class, additional pointe work, variations, partnering (as applicable), choreography, and conditioning. Students refine their technical precision, musicality, and expressiveness through rigorous training rooted in traditional ballet methodology. Dancers are expected to demonstrate discipline, commitment, and a high level of physical and artistic development. Enrollment is by audition or instructor placement only.
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-4"><strong>TapRoots/TapWorks</strong> - Tap Roots is the foundation of our tap program, created by renowned educator Julie Kay Stallcup. This certified curriculum is designed to teach young dancers the essential steps, rhythms, and musicality that every great tap dancer needs. Through fun, engaging classes, students build confidence, coordination, and a strong technical base that will prepare them to grow into our advanced TapWorks program and beyond!
                    <br>TapWorks is our progressive tap program for dancers ready to take their skills to the next level. Building on the strong foundation from Tap Roots, TapWorks challenges dancers with more intricate rhythms, advanced techniques, and dynamic choreography. Dancers will deepen their musicality, technique, and confidence as they grow into skilled, expressive tap artists.
